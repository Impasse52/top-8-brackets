## Usage
Drag and drop `bracket.html` onto OBS, start up the executable and start updating your bracket!

## Customization
Supporting new games is as easy as adding a folder in `Resources/Character` alongs with the game's character icons. 

Need a new graphic? Just replace the default files and play around with `bracket.css` and `layout.css` to create the perfect layout for your streaming.

## TODO
- Improve the UI
